Hi, Alana!

Hope your week is going well. My name is Artem Kushner, I'm an RA in the Math department at Khanh Dao-Duc lab and am writing with regards to obtaining the payslips for this fall. I apologize sincerely if this is a common question.

I would guess that this is because of the relatively recent update to the fin infrastructure at UBC due to COVID, but I'm unfortunately unable to see any paystubs for months earlier than November ( attaching a screenshot) even though I have been employed in this position since May. I recall that there were other sites with different interfaces, but I am only able to find Workday at this point as pointed to by UBC. 


I'm wondering what should I do or who to contact to get those payslips? I need them unfortunately to file a grant application that would reimburse most of my salary to the department.
Grateful for any information you can provide! 
Positively, 
Artem
