Concerning the spread of ligand-prediction with respect to evolutionary divergence:

- Structural divergence between two proteins of the same class
- Sequence divergence between two proteins of the same class

What about ensemble-like learning?

- Structural divergence between two clusters of proteins(larger biomolecule) _given_ their  cumulative evolutionary divergence.
